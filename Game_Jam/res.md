***~Programming~***  
Programming is one of the essential components of game development (shocking truly) and can seem very daunting if you have minimal experience with it, but there are a lot of tools out there to help you!

**Game Engines**
The Cambridge Game Jam has no limits on what game engine you use as long as you do not require players to download it in order to run your game! (We recommend you check how to export a game as a .exe or other playable format from your preferred enginge before the jam starts to save half an hour of panic at the end of realising you don't know how to upload it in the correct format)

====
There are a number of good general purpose engines:

    -  Unity : https://unity.com/
*(one of the most popular engines - has a plethora of tutorials online and lots of community support, proprietary but has free version that has most features - languages:  C#)*

    -  Godot : https://godotengine.org/
*(open source, free engine, rising in popularity - languages: C#, C, C++ and VisualScript)*

    -  Unreal  : https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US
*(free, used frequently in industry, but more complex learning curve than most of the others listed here - language: C++)*

    -  Construct : https://www.construct.net/en
*(proprietary but has a free version with less features, game engine primarily aimed at non-programmers primarily - allowing for games made using event sheets rather than code, available in web without download - language: Javascript)*

   -  Game Maker Studio:  https://gamemaker.io/en
*(proprietary - has free version but won't allow you to export for the jam with it sorry, used in many hit indie titles - uses own language: GML Code)*

====

Language Specific Game Libraries:
  - Pygame (for Python) : https://www.pygame.org/news
  - Monogame (for C#) : https://www.monogame.net/ (used for games such as Stardew Valley and Celeste!)

No-Code Required Game Engines:
  - Stencyl (drag and drop interface, similar to scratch but with more options) : https://www.stencyl.com/

And other genre-specific Engines (most use custom languages):

   - RPG Maker (for making RPGs) : https://www.rpgmakerweb.com/
   - Adventure Game Studio (for making Point and Click Adventure games) : https://www.adventuregamestudio.co.uk/
   - Ren'Py (for making visual novels - language is python) : https://www.renpy.org/
  -  Twine or Inkle (for making choice-based narrative games, twine is limited to text only but inky can be incorporated into other engines especially unity)  : https://twinery.org/,  https://www.inklestudios.com/

====
**IDEs**
A lot of the engines listed above come with their own coding environments but if you use one that isn't and you're new to programming here are two recommendations.

Visual Studio Code : https://code.visualstudio.com/
Lightweight coding environment with extensions to support the vast majority of languages

Xcode : https://developer.apple.com/xcode/
Recommended IDE for Mac Users

====
*** ~Art~*** 
Art is another important component of game development and there's multiple valid ways to go about it! You can try your hand at making your own assets or utilise the many freely available and usable art assets online.

An offhand recommendation for those who are more into code than art: post-processing and programmed shader effects can really enhance and make a game's visuals unique even if using stock assets!

====

**Art Programs**
I will mainly be recommending free programs as I feel the paid for ones are far more well known.

Easy to use, free programs:
   -  FireAlpaca : https://firealpaca.com/
   -  Gimp :  https://www.gimp.org/
As an artsy person I would recommend FireAlpaca over Gimp as FireAlpaca is much more modern in style than Gimp but lots of people use Gimp effectively so it would feel wrong to not mention it.

Feature-filled free programs:
   -  Krita : https://krita.org/en/
Krita is an amazing free art program that works on Windows, Mac *and* Linux (this is shocking for an art program that's not Gimp trust me). 

Pixel Art Specific: 
   -  GraphicsGale  : https://graphicsgale.com/us/
   -  Aseprite : https://www.aseprite.org/
GraphicsGale is free but Aseprite whilst typically paid for is open source and has instructions on how to be built here: https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/blob/main/INSTALL.md - and comes with high recommendations from the people I know who do lots of pixel art.

3D Art Programs:
   -  Blender : https://www.blender.org/
Really the only obvious recommendation lol

====
**Freely Available Assets**
I would recommend checking specific licensces on assets before you download and use them (make sure they're free for personal use and redistribution)

*Remember to credit the creators if you use free assets in your games*

***~Audio~ *** 
Audio is an oft-overlooked (especially in gamejams) component of game making but it can enhance a game's experience incredibly. I have much less experience with audio than art and code but I hope these recommendations will remain somewhat helpful!

====

**Audio Creation Tools**
  -  Audacity : https://www.audacityteam.org/
*(Free editor for SFX and music)*

 -  LMMS : https://lmms.io/
*(An open- source music production application, made as an alternative to proprietary options like FL Studio, which is what the soundtrack to games like Undertale were produced in!)*

 -  SFXR :   https://www.drpetter.se/project_sfxr.html
*(SFX generation tool made specifically for game jams!)*

 -  Chiptone : https://sfbgames.itch.io/chiptone
*(For very gamey SFX creation)*

  -  Beepbox : https://www.beepbox.co/
  -  Bosca Ceoil : https://boscaceoil.net/
*(Both of these are good simple alternatives to making Game OST rather than LMMS which is a full music production suite)*

====

**Freely Available Assets**
